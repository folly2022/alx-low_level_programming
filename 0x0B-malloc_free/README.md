1.  a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
2.  a function that concatenates two strings.
3.  a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
4.   a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
5. a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
6. a function that splits a string into words.
